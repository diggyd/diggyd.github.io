  <p>Just how often are people choosing to reach for a game controller instead of a TV remote? An overview of the numbers paints an illuminating picture. In 2019, the gaming industry generated $120 billion in revenue, and experts predict it could reach $200 billion within two years; 100 million viewers tuned in to watch players compete in the World Championship of the game League of Legends — a larger haul than the telecast of the Super Bowl; and, by 2021, it’s projected that 2.7 billion people — about one-third of the global population — will be gamers.</p>
  <p>For decades, virtual reality has tantalized gamers with the prospect of a fully immersive experience. But the technology has yet to deliver on this promise.

    Tech companies are looking to change that. Huge firms like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Sony — and startups like Magic Leap — have invested considerable resources to develop VR hardware and games.
    
    VR is still a niche category when compared to the rest of the gaming industry. And despite its buzzy status, it continues to give many consumers pause.
    
    “Right now we’re sort of in this trough of disillusionment about VR,” Kevin Mack, a VR game developer, told Built In. “There was a lot of hype around it in 2015 and 2016, and then the whole world sort of got butt-hurt that their first-generation VR headset didn’t instantly morph into the Holodeck.”
    
    When it comes to VR, we’re still in the early days. There are promising developments on the horizon. But first, a few challenges need to be addressed.</p>
    <p>For the future of consumer VR to be more than a niche hobby for people with high disposable income — or a once-in-a-while theme park experience — several hardware challenges will need to be overcome. Namely, the bulky headsets.

      Most VR headsets weigh well over a pound and must be strapped tightly to a user’s face. I t’s not terribly comfortable. You get sweaty and after a half-hour of play your energy is sapped.
      
      This experience chafes against that mode of playing which is typical of gaming enthusiasts — spending hours comfortably sunk into a couch. If VR hardware can’t align with the preferences of gamers, will it be able to survive? Until companies slim down their VR headsets — and price points — most gamers, save the early adopters and tech enthusiasts, will continue to balk.</p>
